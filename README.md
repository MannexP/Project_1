#Problems w/ Game
Scalability! In begining to build a player 1 and 2 option I realized how that would be impossible for a game that was larger. As is the game is functional, keeps track of score, indicates right or wrong ( or gives the illusion of right or wrong), but the gameis not connected. Each click event corresponds to a tile which appears to be a fluid game (MVP).

#Phase 2
Creating an OOP game. Inserting the questions, answers and tiles into an object, in order to manipulate the DOM with out writing 1000 lines of code. Create a a function that loops through the object and selects a key and value acording to a click. At least thats how i would begin to approach it.
